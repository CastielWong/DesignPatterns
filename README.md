This repository is used to have a quick overview on those design patterns introduced from the book __Head First Design Patterns__.

## Design Principle

- Favor composition over inheritance

## Strategy

The __Strategy__ Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
